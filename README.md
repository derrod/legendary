Legendary is an open-source game launcher that can download and install games from the Epic Games Store on Linux and Windows.
It's name as a tongue-in-cheek play on tiers of [item rarity in many MMORPGs](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Quality).

Right now it is in an early public testing stage and still needs a lot of work to work. But it does work!

**What works:**
 - Authenticating with Epic's service
 - Downloading and installing your games and their DLC
 - Delta patching/updating of installed games
 - Launching games with online authentication (for multiplayer)
 - Running games with WINE on Linux

**Planned:**
 - Simple GUI for managing/launching games
 - Importing installed games from the EGS launcher
 - Better interfaces for other developers to use Legendary in their projects
 - Lots and lots of bug fixes, optimizations, and refactoring...

## Requirements

- python 3.8+ (64-bit on Windows)
- requests
- setuptools (only when installing/building)

## How to run/install

### Package Manager

Depending on your Distro legendary may be available via (unofficial) packages that can be directly installed using your package manager.
Check out the [Available Linux Packages](https://github.com/derrod/legendary/wiki/Available-Linux-Packages) wiki page for details.

Currently this is limited to Arch Linux (AUR) and Fedora but will hopefully be expanded to other distros rather soon.

- [Fedora](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/legendary): `sudo dnf install legendary`

### Standalone
Download the latest `legendary` or `legendary.exe` binary from [the latest release](https://github.com/derrod/legendary/releases/latest)
and move it to somewhere in your `$PATH`/`%PATH%`. Don't forget to `chmod +x` it on Linux.

The Windows .exe and Linux executable were created with PyInstaller and will run standalone even without python being installed.
Note that on Linux glibc >= 2.25 is required, so older distributions such as Ubuntu 16.04 or Debian stretch will not work.

### Python package

Via PyPI: `pip install legendary-gl`

Manually:
- Install python3.8, setuptools and requests
- Clone the git repository
- Run `python3.8 setup.py install`

#### Ubuntu 20.04 example

Ubuntu 20.04's standard repositories include everything needed to install legendary:
````bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-requests python3-setuptools-git
git clone https://github.com/derrod/legendary.git
cd legendary
sudo python3 setup.py install
````

Note that in this example we used `sudo` to install the package on the system, this may not be advisable depending on your setup.

### Directly from the repo (for dev/testing)

- Install python3.8 and requests (optionally in a venv)
- cd into `legendary/` (the folder with `cli.py`)
- run `PYTHONPATH=.. python3.8 cli.py`

## Quickstart

To log in:
````
$ legendary auth
````
Authentication is a little finicky since we have to go through the Epic website. The login page should open in your browser and after logging in you should be presented with a JSON response that contains a code, just copy and paste the code into your terminal to log in.

Listing your games
````
$ legendary list-games
````
This will fetch a list of games available on your account, the first time may take a while depending on how many games you have.

Installing a game
````
$ legendary download Anemone
````
**Important:** the name used for these commands is the app name, *not* the game's name! The app name is in the parentheses after the game title in the games list.

List installed games and check for updates
````
$ legendary list-installed --check-updates
````

Launch (run) a game with online authentication
````
$ legendary launch Anemone
````
**Tip:** most games will run fine offline (`--offline`), and thus won't require launching through legendary for online authentication. You can run `legendary launch <App Name> --offline --dry-run` to get a command line that will launch the game with all parameters that would be used by the Epic Launcher. These can then be entered into any other game launcher (e.g. Lutris/Steam) if the game requires them.
